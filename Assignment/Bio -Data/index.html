    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family 
        moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved 
        to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss 
        Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, 
        the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching 
        post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his
         doctor’s degree.
